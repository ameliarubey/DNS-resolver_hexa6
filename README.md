## Overview

DNS Resolver v2 is a web-based application that simulates and visualizes the DNS resolution process. It walks users through each step of an iterative DNS lookup — from querying root nameservers to TLD servers to authoritative nameservers — and presents the results in a clean, human-readable interface.

Beyond basic resolution, the tool offers a comprehensive set of network utilities including WHOIS lookup, DNS propagation checking, port scanning, security analysis, performance benchmarking, geographic IP mapping, and a full DNS history recorder.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16 or higher
- **npm** v7 or higher

---

## Installation

**1. Clone or extract the project**

```bash
# If you have the zip file:
unzip dns-resolver-v2-fixed.zip
cd dns-resolver-v2-fixed/project
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

This installs Express 5 and all required packages. The `node_modules/` directory is already included in the archive, so this step is optional if you prefer to use the bundled dependencies.

---

## Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```

or equivalently:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server starts on **port 3000**. Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You will be greeted by the main dashboard, from which all features are accessible.

## How It Works

### DNS Cache

The server maintains an **in-memory DNS cache** keyed by `domain|type`. Each entry stores the resolved data, the original TTL, and an expiry timestamp. On every resolve request, the cache is checked first. Expired entries are evicted lazily on access.

### Iterative Resolution Simulation

The `resolveWithSteps()` function simulates the full iterative DNS resolution process:

1. **Cache check** — returns immediately if a valid cached entry exists.
2. **Root server query** — contacts one of three hardcoded IANA root server IPs and adds a simulated network delay.
3. **TLD server query** — looks up the appropriate TLD nameserver (`.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.in`, `.io` supported) with simulated latency.
4. **Authoritative server query** — performs the actual DNS resolution using Node's built-in `dns.promises` module and records the result along with TTL.

Each step is returned as a structured object, allowing the frontend to display the full resolution trace.

### Persistent History

DNS lookup history is stored in `dns_history.json` in the project root. This file is read and written on each history record/query request, allowing history to persist across server restarts.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Node.js |
| **Web Framework** | Express 5 |
| **DNS Resolution** | Node.js built-in `dns` module (`dns.promises`) |
| **Networking** | Node.js built-in `net` module (TCP port scanning) |
| **Frontend** | Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Data Storage** | In-memory object (cache) + JSON file (history) |

---

## Notes

- The **iterative resolution steps** (root and TLD server queries) are **simulated** with realistic latency using `setTimeout`. The final authoritative lookup is performed using the real system DNS resolver.
- Port scanning uses raw TCP connections with a **3-second timeout** per port. Results indicate whether a port is `open` or `closed/filtered`.
- DNS history is stored in plain JSON and is not encrypted. Do not record sensitive domains in shared environments.
- The server is designed for **local/educational use**. It is not hardened for production deployment.
